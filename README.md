Stands for **ViliX's Text/ASCII Game Engine**. It's more of a framework than a game engine.

In the future, VilTAGE should be able to provide an easy way of making Dart ASCII based games.

### Creating new game

To demonstrate how simple it is to create a new VilTAGE game (read more on wiki), here are three steps you need to make to create new game:

1. add `dependency viltage: any` to your project's pubspec.yaml
2. add `import 'package:viltage/viltage.dart';` to the top of your main .dart file
3. add those two lines to your `main()` function:
```
VilTAGEConfig vtc = new VilTAGEConfig(querySelector("#game_canvas"));
VilTAGE mygame = new VilTAGE(vtc);
```
This will take a canvas element and create a blank grid of dots, which becomes a foundation for a new game.
